# Animated_screensaver
Animated screensaver. Like the good old days DVD icon.

Remember before there was a DVD logo on your player that appeared when you didn’t use your TV for a long time?
So, the inspiration of the 00s prompted the creation of something similar.

--Getting to the point--
This is a simple script that selects your pictures and loads on top of the entire screen. 
It is advisable that the photo has a transparent background and is in PNG format.
In the СONFIG.py file you will change the settings for the size of the image that will “walk across the screen”


In the next commits I plan to make friends between my app and windows...

I will be very glad to see your comments and recommendations.
